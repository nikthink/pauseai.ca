We are a community of volunteers that aims to mitigate
the risks of AI by convincing governments to
pause the development of superhuman AI.  
PauseAI informs the public, talks to policy-makers, and organizes events. 

At pauseai montreal, we:

- Find people already concerned about AI at meetups around montreal
- Meet and discuss how AI should be regulated, deployed, to make it safe and help humanity rather than cause issues
- Put up posters around the city
- Email and talk to local politicians to push them to vote for AI regulation
- ... and more to come!

If you want to get involved or have questions,
join one of our [meetups](https://luma.com/pauseaimtl),  
join our [discord server](https://pauseai.ca/mtl/discord),
or email nik at <nicolas.m.lacombe@gmail.com>.

More content to come. for now see [pauseai.info](https://pauseai.info)
