We are a community of volunteers that aims to mitigate
the risks of AI by convincing governments to
pause the development of superhuman AI.  
PauseAI informs the public, talks to policy-makers, and organizes events. 

Join us at one of our [events](https://luma.com/pauseaimtl) !
Or talk to us on [discord](/mtl/discord.html).

To subscribe to our mailing list, send an email to <pauseai-mtl-subscribe@lists.riseup.net>.

At PauseAI Montréal, we:

- Find people already concerned about AI at meetups around Montréal
- Meet and discuss how AI should be regulated, deployed, to make it safe and help humanity rather than cause issues
- Put up posters around the city
- Email and talk to local politicians to push them to vote for AI regulation
- ... and more to come!
